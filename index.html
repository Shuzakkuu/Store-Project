            Our Mission
        </h1>

        <p>
            To put it simply, Our mission with F*** Coffee is to make the worst cup of coffee you have ever tasted. We strive for imperfection, and put pride in how bad our coffee actually is.
             This mission stems from the fact that we all hate coffee. We were tired of watching countless companies fight eachother over who has the best product, so we decided to create the worst.
              Every cup and every bag of beans is fueled with the hate of the environment it was created in. We hate our product, but we know you'll love it because you are addicted, and we will esnure that addiction continues.
